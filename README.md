# purpleplum-java-assignment
Repository for Purpleplum Java assignment

This guide provides instructions to run the Java Spring Boot application with Maven, set up the MySQL database, and then run the APIs.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 11 or later** (Make sure you have the correct version installed by running `java -version`).
- **Maven** (Make sure Maven is installed and accessible via `mvn -v`).
- **MySQL** (Make sure MySQL is installed and running).
- **Postman** (Optional, for testing the APIs).
  
## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine:
    
        git clone <your-repository-url>
        cd <your-repository-directory>

#### 2. Configure MySQL Database

#### a. Create a Database in MySQL
1. Log into MySQL using the MySQL command line or MySQL Workbench:

    mysql -u root -p
   
2. Create a new database for the application and insert data into DB my using the purpleplum_customer.sql scripts.

#### 3. Configure application.properties for Spring Boot

	# MySQL Database Configuration
	spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/customer_db?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
	spring.datasource.username=root
	spring.datasource.password=<your-mysql-password>
	spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
	spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
	spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
	spring.jpa.show-sql=true

	# AES Secret Key for Encryption (16 bytes for AES-128)
	aes.secret.key=1234567890abcdef
	
#### 4. Build the Project Using Maven:
	mvn clean install

#### 5. Run the Spring Boot Application

#### 7. Implement Encryption and Decryption
	The customerâ€™s customerIdentifierNumber field is sensitive information and is encrypted before storing it in the database.
	When the Get API is called the customerIdentifierNumber is descrypted back and returned.

#### 6. Test the APIs
	You can now test the APIs using Postman or directly via browser for simple GET requests.
	Base URL: http://localhost:8080/api/customers
	API Endpoints:
	POST /api/customers - Create a new customer.
	GET /api/customers?filter=johndoe@example.com&page=0&size=10&sortBy=customerName&sortDir=asc - Get all customers with pagination, sorting, and filtering.
	(filter query param accepts customer to be filtered by Country, State, Email)
	(sorting is asc by default if not provided)
	GET /api/customers/{id} - Get a customer by ID.
	GET /api/customers/decrypt/{id} - Get a customer by ID with Decrypted Identifier Numbeer.
	PUT /api/customers/{id} - Update a customer by ID.
	DELETE /api/customers/{id} - Delete a customer by ID.
	
#### 7. Testing with Postman
    
    Open Postman and import the provided Postman Collection purpleplum_customer.postman_collection.json.
    Base URL: http://localhost:8080/api/customers
	API Endpoints:
	POST /api/customers - Create a new customer.
	GET /api/customers?filter=johndoe@example.com&page=0&size=10&sortBy=customerName&sortDir=asc - Get all customers with pagination, sorting, and filtering.
	(filter query param accepts customer to be filtered by Country, State, Email)
	(sorting is asc by default if not provided)
	GET /api/customers/{id} - Get a customer by ID.
	GET /api/customers/decrypt/{id} - Get a customer by ID with Decrypted Identifier Numbeer.
	PUT /api/customers/{id} - Update a customer by ID.
	DELETE /api/customers/{id} - Delete a customer by ID.
